This repository contains two ImageJ macros:  
* An "ImageJ microscope" which simulates a microsope acquiring TIF fluorescence images every few seconds and dumping them in a folder in the hard drive;  
* An "ImageJ server" which continuously monitors the first folder, grabs TIF images, moves them into a second folder and does some image analysis (in this case, image segmentation and nuclei counting).  

This is intended to be the backbone of advanced workflows, where a complex bioimage analysis algorithm can be made available to many users in a lab or imaging facility, who simply have to place images in a shared folder to have them analyzed.
